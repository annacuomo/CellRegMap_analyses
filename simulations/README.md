# Simulation experiments

This directory contains code for reproducing the simulation experiments.

The ``notebooks`` folder contains .ipynb scripts for generating the synthetic
datasets. Once generated, the Snakemake file can be used to execute
``utils/run_tests.py`` across a range of different simulation settings.
