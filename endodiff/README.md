## Application to a continuous trajectory of iPS cells differentiating towards definitive endoderm

Application of CellRegMap model on data from [Cuomo et al, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14457-z).

## Contents:

* Running CellRegMap for an example gene-SNP pair
* Plotting an example as in Fig. 3

<!-- - ``scripts/settings.py`` Default simulation parameters.
- ``scripts/sim_utils.py`` Utility functions for the simulation experiments.
- ``scripts/simulate.py`` Main simulation script. 

The ``notebooks`` folder contains ``.ipynb`` files to generate the simulation settings as well as code to reproduce the figures.

- ``notebooks/save_params.ipynb`` Create ``params.csv`` used in this paper.
- ``notebooks/test_calibration.ipynb`` Calibration experiments.
- ``notebooks/test_power.ipynb`` Power experiments. -->
