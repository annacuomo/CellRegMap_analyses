## Application to a continuous trajectory of iPS cells differentiating towards definitive endoderm

Application of CellRegMap model on data from [Cuomo et al, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14457-z).

## Contents:

The following folders contain scripts for data processing and analysis.
A short description can be found below:

* [CellRegMap examples](../endodiff/usage/) contains (python) jupyter notebooks showing usage of CellRegMap on these data.

* [Prepocessing scripts](../endodiff/preprocessing/) contains R and python jupyter notebooks illustrating pre-processing steps.

* [Plotting notebooks](../endodiff/plotting/) contains R and python jupyter notebooks to reproduce the [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.01.458524v1)'s figures (main and supplements).


<!-- * Running CellRegMap for an example gene-SNP pair
* Plotting an example as in Fig. 3 -->

<!-- - ``scripts/settings.py`` Default simulation parameters.
- ``scripts/sim_utils.py`` Utility functions for the simulation experiments.
- ``scripts/simulate.py`` Main simulation script. 

The ``notebooks`` folder contains ``.ipynb`` files to generate the simulation settings as well as code to reproduce the figures.

- ``notebooks/save_params.ipynb`` Create ``params.csv`` used in this paper.
- ``notebooks/test_calibration.ipynb`` Calibration experiments.
- ``notebooks/test_power.ipynb`` Power experiments. -->
